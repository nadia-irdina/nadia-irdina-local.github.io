[The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)) is an American TV show that ran for 11 seasons since 2010 and ended with its last episode in 2022. It is set in a <b> post-apocalyptic world </b> and follows a group of survivors.

The group expands, travels and goes through many moral and physical challenges. Over time, members of this "family" get killed off, resulting in a <b>high emotional reaction</b> among its audience.
