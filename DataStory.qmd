[The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)) is an American TV show that ran for 11 seasons since 2010 and ended with its last episode in 2022. It is set in a <b> post-apocalyptic world </b> and follows a group of survivors.

The group expands, travels and goes through many moral and physical challenges. Over time, members of this "family" get killed off, resulting in a <b>high emotional reaction</b> among its audience.

### Data Narrative

This analysis aims to understand the reasons why this well-loved show, given its loyal fanbase, a dramatic and gory genre, and a long run time, experienced a fall from grace. 

According to the [Lost Angeles
Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-20/the-walking-dead-took-the-television-revolution-to-a-whole-new-omigod-what-is-that-level),
**The Walking Dead** is a piece of fictional media that is ingrained in
the lives of many families in America and internationally - and it was
due to its ability to subvert traditional expectations surrounding TV
shows.

Furthermore, in light of the **2023 Writer's Strike** which aimed at
fair compensation and has negatively impacted many productions,
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/09/02/amc-brokers-a-strike-deal-so-the-walking-dead-can-start-filming-again/?sh=5793fc8c9dc1)
mentioned that its spin-offs were not affected, but I believe that the
grievances surrounding writers in America have affected the quality of
the show over the years.

On a personal level, the show is one I grew up with, and I had witnessed first-hand its monumental
rise and devastating fall. Towards, the end, I saw a significant drop in
engagement worldwide, with [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/the-walking-dead-what-the-hell-happened-to-this-show-627893/)
theorising that its drop in popularity was due to narrative choices.

However, I want to look at more numerical perspectives.

## Main Question:

**What are some factors that may affect the longevity (and popularity) of the TV show: "The Walking Dead"?**

## Data Set

The data I am working with is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/the-walking-dead-episodes?resource=download), created by Bill Cruise and updated 9 months ago.

It has 2 csv files: episodes and IMDB

### Names of Variables within Episodes Dataset

```{r, eval=T,echo=F}
twd_episodes<-read.csv("the_walking_dead_episodes.csv")
names(twd_episodes)
```

### Names of Variables within IMDB Dataset

```{r, eval=T,echo=F}
twd_imdb <- read.csv("the_walking_dead_imdb.csv")
names(twd_imdb)
```

## Answering the Question:

How to answer?:
  - comparing variable: *"us_viewers"* against *"original_air_date."* to see how if a particular year has some significance to the success or failure 
  - comparing variable: *"directed_by"* against *"us_viewers"* to see which directors are more influential, and by extension, responsible for its success or failure
  - comparing variable: *"written_by"* against *"us_viewers"* to see which writers are influential and thereby responsible for its success or failure, with focus on narrative elements. 
  - comparing variable: *"imdb_rating"* against *"seasons"* to support or challenge the insights from viewcount and draw links to the writers and directors of the show
