    "text": "Who are the Directors and what is their impact to the show?\nUpon looking at the seasonal popularity and showing a distribution skewed to the right, it begs the question as to what causes the dip in popularity other than the time factor.\nAn episode is engaging when its cinematography and action sequences are appealing to the audience. It’s when the characters are portrayed well and fleshed out visually, alongside good visual effects and constuming for the zombies. This is determined by the episode’s director, and the walking dead engaged 55 different directors throughout its runtime.\nBased on the table below, Greg Nicotero is a director that has the most amount of impact in determining how the show succeeds. However, his average viewcount is not the maximum value. Ernest Dickerson holds the title.\nThis means that the success of the show is not necessarily determined by who it is directed by.\n\n\n# A tibble: 55 × 3\n   directed_by           episode_count average_viewcount\n   &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Greg Nicotero                    37          9494324.\n 2 Michael E.

Looking at only his viewcount for the episodes he directed, we see that an episode in 2016 is the most popular, but this is an anomaly.\nOn average, in the earlier seasons, the range in his viewcount is wider but the viewcount in itself is still impressive. This plummets in 2015 onwards, where the viewcount depletes significantly. However, the range is smaller as the seasons go by, suggesting that he is directing episodes that are consistently doing poorly."

For more in-depth breakdowns of what each writer does and the collaborations of the writers, scroll through here:  \n\nLooking at Angela and Scott specifically:\nAngela Kang and Scott M. Gimple are well-loved show writers. Audiences are most familiar with their work relative to other writers of the show. As seen below, Angela Kang worked on the show for a longer period of time (8 years) compared to Scott (6 years). The shape of their curves are also similar, with Angela’s viewcount consistently high between 2013-2017. Meanwhile, the distribution of viewcounts for Scott seem to be at an incline over the years, before a drastic drop in 2017.\nFor Scott, there is an abnormally range of viewcount in 2013 despite only working independently on 3 episodes that year. This means that his writing may not be consistently of good quality that year."

    "text": "Average IMDB score per Season\nDrawing on the saying: “Qualtity &gt; Quantity”, we focus now IMDB ratings. IMDB rating is an aggregated score based on votes by individuals. The show they vote on a scale from 1-10 indicate how good, subjectively, they perceive the show. The more people vote on the higher end of the scale, the higher the show’s IMDB rating, thereby we can assume that the show is “GOOD”.\n\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 4\n   season mean_imdb min_imdb max_imdb\n    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1      1      8.53      8.1      9.2\n 2      2      8.35      7.5      9.2\n 3      3      8.37      7.7      9.3\n 4      4      8.26      7.3      9.6\n 5      5      8.36      7.4      9.6\n 6      6      8.28      6.9      9.6\n 7      7      7.47      5.7      9.2\n 8      8      7.05      6.2      8  \n 9      9      7.99      7.2      9.3\n10     10      7.39      4.1      9.2\n11     11      7.77      6.6      8.7\n\n\nOn average Season 1 has the highest IMDB rating of 8.53/10. Conversely, Season 8 is the worst performing season with an average IMDB rating of 7.05/10.\nHowever, based on the graph below, the spread of IMDB ratings for episodes in Season 10 is largest, and contains very significant low ratings. Comparing Season 8 and 10, it seems that although season 10 has 3 episodes with signficantly low ratings, it does not affect the average IMDB rating because it has MORE episodes in the season."

There is a positive linear relationship from 2010 to 2014, before gradually declining to the minimum point in 2022. This indicates that the show is popular in its early run time, and people lose interest after 2014.\n\nComparing Viewership Over Time, grouped by Season\nColour-coding the seasons in the graph better indicates which seasons won the hearts of audiences.
