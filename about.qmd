# Self-Introduction

Welcome to my webpage! My name is <b>[Nadia Irdina Yuzaimi.]{style="color: #800080;"}</b> I'm 21 years old and I'm a proud Year 2 undergrad student majoring in [Communications and New Media.]{style="colour:blue"}

I like learning about pop-culture, digital media and analysing fictional content. I spend of my free time listening to podcasts, namely from the "true crime" and "lifestyle" genre.

This is why I am interested in delivering data insights pertaining to fictional content.
